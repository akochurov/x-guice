Classes with @DB annotated methods should:
<ul>
    <li>Have an EntityManager field</li>
    <li>EntityManager field should not be static</li>
</ul>
Usage of EntityManager field allowed only in @DB annotated methods.
<br/>
If @DB annotated method use EntityManager for persist, merge or remove operations,
transaction support must be enabled,
else using of transaction support is not required and could be the cause of performance problems.
<br/>
Methods <i>joinTransaction()</i> and <i>getTransaction</i> should not be used into @DB annotated methods.
Use @DB(transaction=REQUIRED) instead.
